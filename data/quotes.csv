"once upon a time, there lived a boy and a girl. the boy was eighteen and the girl sixteen. he was not unusually handsome, and she was not especially beautiful. they were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. but they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100 perfect boy and the 100 perfect girl for them. yes, they believed in a miracle. and that miracle actually happened. one day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street. this is amazing, he said. i ve been looking for you all my life. you may not believe this, but you re the 100 perfect girl for me. and you, she said to him, are the 100 perfect boy for me, exactly as i d pictured you in every detail. it s like a dream. they sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. they were not lonely anymore. they had found and been found by their 100 perfect other. what a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100 perfect other. it s a miracle, a cosmic miracle. as they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts was it really all right for one s dreams to come true so easily? and so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, let s test ourselves - just once. if we really are each other s 100 perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. and when that happens, and we know that we are the 100 perfect ones, we ll marry then and there. what do you think? yes, she said, that is exactly what we should do. and so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west. the test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. they should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other s 100 perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. but it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. the cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully. one winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season s terrible inluenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. when they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young d. h. lawrence s piggy bank. they were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75 or even 85 love. time passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty. one beautiful april morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, but along the same narrow street in the harajuku neighborhood of tokyo. they passed each other in the very center of the street. the faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. each felt a rumbling in their chest. and they knew she is the 100 perfect girl for me. he is the 100 perfect boy for me. but the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fouteen years earlier. without a word, they passed each other, disappearing into the crowd. forever. a sad story, don t you think?",The Elephant Vanishes,665,"ordinary, loneliness, belief","hope, connection, innocence","['ordinary', 'loneliness', 'belief']","['hope', 'connection', 'innocence']",678,3654,1.0,1.0,0,0,1,The Elephant Vanishes
